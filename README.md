## Overview
### Description
As a foodie who often experiences decision fatigue when it comes to figuring out where I want to eat, I created this app so that the decision would be made for me. Users are then pushed to try new restaurants in their area. In WaWe, users can filter what type of restaurant they want to eat at by indicating the cuisine type, price range, distance, and whether or not they want to try a new place. Based on the filters, WaWe pulls up a restaurant in the area for the user to go to. Users can mark restaurants as visited and/or favorite them and view them off and online. This allows the WaWe algorithm to give users the best recommendation possible based on their favorited restaurants. Users can also create groups and post in them to facilitate meetups. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food
- **Mobile:** This app is suitable for mobile use because users can easily get their restaurant recommendation and the directions to the location.
- **Story:** Do you hate being asked "Where do you wanna go to eat?" Or do you feel like you've been going to the same restaurants over and over again and want to try something new? Well, you're in the right place because with Restaurant Roulette this decision is made for you!
- **Market:** This app is targeted towards people who like to eat out and either have trouble deciding where to eat or want to try new restaurants 
- **Habit:** Users would use this app every time they don't know where to eat out--this depends on how often users eat out 
- **Scope:** This app will take out the decision process that comes along with trying to figure out where to eat: users will be able to use this app to try new restaurants they've never been to before

### 4. Required Components

    * double tap to add a restaurant to favorites 
* Your app incorporates at least one external library to add visual polish
    * Glide to add images 
    * Lottie for animations 
* Your app uses at least one animation (e.g. fade in/out, e.g. animating a view growing and shrinking)
    * Loading animation
    * Animation when user likes a restaurant 
  
### Technical Problems
* Filtering: After making the API call to Yelp I will take the 50 restaurants that the API gives me. I create an algorithm that uses the userâ€™s favorite restaurants to give the user the best possible restaurant recommendation based on their filters. This is a complex problem because the algorithm tailors itself to each user.
* User and Data Persistence: I will be caching information so that if there is a network issue, the user can still see their favorite restaurants, restaurants they have visited, already existing groups, and posts that have been posted in each group. This is a complex problem because I used SQLite and Room both of which I have not used before.
