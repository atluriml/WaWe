## Overview
### Description
WaWe is an app that pulls up a restaurant in the area for the user to try. Users can filter by indicating the cuisine type, price range, and distance. The app will keep track of whether or not the user has visited a restaurant to help ensure that it does not reccomend the user the same restaurant over and over again. When the user is given a recomendation, the location of the resaurant will be given, and the app will give the user directions on how to get there.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Food
- **Mobile:** This app is suitable for mobile use because users can easily get their restaurant recommendation and the directions to the location.
- **Story:** Do you hate being asked "Where do you wanna go to eat?" Or do you feel like you've been going to the same restaurants over and over again and want to try something new? Well, you're in the right place because with Restaurant Roulette this decision is made for you!
- **Market:** This app is targeted towards people who like to eat out and either have trouble deciding where to eat or want to try new restaurants 
- **Habit:** Users would use this app every time they don't know where to eat out--this depends on how often users eat out 
- **Scope:** This app will take out the decision process that comes along with trying to figure out where to eat: users will be able to use this app to try new restaurants they've never been to before

### Technical Problems
* Filtering: After making the API call to Yelp I will take the 50 restaurants that the API gives me. I create an algorithm that uses the userâ€™s favorite restaurants to give the user the best possible restaurant recommendation based on their filters. This is a complex problem because the algorithm tailors itself to each user.
* User and Data Persistence: I will be caching information so that if there is a network issue, the user can still see their favorite restaurants, restaurants they have visited, already existing groups, and posts that have been posted in each group. This is a complex problem because I used SQLite and Room both of which I have not used before.
